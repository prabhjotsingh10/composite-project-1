# composite-project-1

This is a webpage that is a redesign of BlackBoard, which is a portal for gathering information about our courses and current program students are enrolled in humber college. 
I have added a new course homepage along with information about schedules, quizzes, assignments, grades and announcements.
I have used HTML and CSS.
To run the file, just download the files or clone them to your repository and open with google chrome or any other mainstream browser that you use.
I hope you like it.Thanks.
